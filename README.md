Oversampling: Balanced the dataset with 1,233 "Yes" and 1,233 "No" observations, resulting in 2,466 total records to address class imbalance.
Data Partitioning: 80% training set, 20% test set for model building and evaluation.

# Top Contributors leading to attrition

1. Overtime: 
More than half of employees who left worked overtime.
Overtime is a major contributing factor to employee turnover. 
Implement a flexible work policy to reduce overtime and promote work-life balance, and monitor its impact on employee retention for the next 3 months.

2. Marital Status:
Over 50% of employees with single marital status have left the company
Single employees are more likely to leave the company. 
Develop a targeted retention program for single employees, focusing on career development opportunities, and social events to foster a sense of community.

3. Tenure at the company:
Most employees leave the company after 1 year. 
The company is experiencing high turnover rates during the first year of employment. 
Tailor the onboarding experience to each new hire's role and needs, assign mentors to new hires to offer guidance and support and provide regular feedback during the first year to reduce turnover.

4. Job Roles:
Lab Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Sales Representative are more likely to leave. 
High overtime + low monthly income contribute to higher attrition in these roles.
For Lab Technicians and Research Scientists: increase salaries to bring them more in line with industry standards and offer an overtime premium to compensate for excessive overtime work.
For Sales Representatives: Develop a performance-based incentive program.
